Lycelia's AuthorPal can be used either online (https://penguinofthesky.github.io/AuthorPal/) or offline (simply download (button top-right) and double-click index.html to run program to use offline ). Benefit of having a local copy is the ability to add images from your computer without using a hosting service.   

Product is built to be Chrome compatible.  Should work in safari/opera as well but not tested. Will work in Firefox/Edge as soon as they make it to 2012 technology and finally implement shadow dom.  

FAQ is included in product.
