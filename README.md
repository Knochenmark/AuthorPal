Lycelia's AuthorPal can be used either online or offline (simply download and double-click index.html to use offline or cache the site). Benefit of having a local copy is the ability to add images from your computer without using a hosting service.  Currently product requires a bit of a hack of inspect element + edit as html to add images but GUI version coming soon.
Product is built to be Chrome compatible.  Should work in safari/opera as well but not tested. Will work in Firefox as soon as they make it to 2012 technology and implement shadow dom. Could this product work without shadow dom? yes, easily. Hardly any effort. Should it? No.  It's 2017, implement ES2015 already firefox/edge. Ty, that is all.
FAQ is included in product.
