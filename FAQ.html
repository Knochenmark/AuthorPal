<h3>About</h3>
<p> AuthorPal is an online/offline app principally built for Google Chrome that is designed to make planning out a novel/screenplay/etc easier than ever before. No erasers or scribbling flashcards but instead a computer-managed system designed to allow you to easily build up the plan for your creative work and quickly access the information you need.

<h3>Saving/Uploading Files</h3>
<p>
  All your work is automatically saved to localStorage every 15 seconds. LocalStorage is sort of like a cookie (but different) and can potentially be deleted when you delete your cache. To save a backup copy go to File (top left) and click Download. This allows you to save a file containing all your work (not just the file you're working on) to either your downloads folder or a folder of your choice if you right-click.
  The data is in json format and can be edited in any text editor/ide capable of working with json. This file can be re-uploaded to Authorpal with File > Upload if you lose your work for some reason (may overwrite data already there if names match).

<h3>Adding Images</h3>
<p>
  Click 'editHTML' then type &lt;img src=''&gt; <br>
  Inside the '' you can add the address to an online hosted image or, if you're running this program locally rather than online, you can link to a filename in local directory (folder).
