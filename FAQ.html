<h3>About</h3>
<p> AuthorPal is an online/offline app principally built for Google Chrome that is designed to make planning out a novel/screenplay/etc easier than ever before. No erasers or scribbling flashcards but instead a computer-managed system designed to allow you to easily build up the plan for your creative work and quickly access the information you need.
